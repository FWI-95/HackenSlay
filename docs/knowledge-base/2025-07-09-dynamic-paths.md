# Dynamic Dirt Path Idea

The conversation proposed adding trails that appear when entities repeatedly walk over grass or soil tiles.

- Each tile tracks a wear value that increases whenever a player, NPC or enemy steps on it.
- After crossing a threshold the texture changes from grass to a dirt path.
- Continued traffic widens the path; lack of traffic allows vegetation to grow back.
- Major roads remain static, but small shortcuts naturally form where entities travel most often.
