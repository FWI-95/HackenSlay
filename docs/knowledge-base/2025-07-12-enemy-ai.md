# Basic Enemy AI

The enemy now uses a simple A* algorithm to chase the player across the tile map.

- `Enemy` calculates a path from its tile position to the player's tile each frame.
- Movement velocity is derived from the next step in the path.
- `Pathfinder` implements a minimal A* search over the map generator tiles.
- Tests verify that obstacles are avoided and the enemy moves toward the player.
