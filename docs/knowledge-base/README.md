# Knowledge Base

This folder collects historical conversations related to the project. Summaries should be created whenever a discussion leads to new features or important design decisions.

## Recommended File Format

Create a new markdown file for each conversation using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`. For example, a conversation on July 7th 2025 about an example topic would be stored as `2025-07-07-example.md`.

Codex will parse these files when generating code, so keeping to this naming scheme helps the agent find relevant discussions.

## How to Record

1. Create a new file in this folder with the date and topic in the filename.
2. Summarize the conversation in a few bullet points or short paragraphs.
3. Commit the file so others can reference it later.
